# Synchronous-FIFO

This project is about a Synchronous FIFO, which is a way to store and move data in a digital system.

It's helpful for making sure data moves smoothly between different parts of a computer chip that work at the same speed.

# Features
Works with Same-Speed Parts: It's designed for parts of a chip that work at the same speed.

You Can Change How Big It Is: You can adjust how much data it can hold to fit your needs.

Tells You When It's Full or Empty: It has signals that tell you if it's full (can't hold any more data) or empty (has no data left).

# Testing
The test_FIFO.v file in this repository contains a testbench to verify the functionality of the FIFO module.

You can use tools like QuestaSim or ModelSim to test how it works.
